abstract = {In this paper, we document the disintegration of international commodity markets between 1913 and 1938. There was dramatic disintegration during World War I, gradual reintegration during the 1920s, and then a substantial disintegration after 1929. The period saw the unravelling of many of the integration gains of 1870–1913. While increased transport costs help explain the wartime disintegration, they cannot explain the post-1929 increase in trade costs. The proliferation of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, the collapse of the interwar gold standard, and the evaporation of commercial credit loom large as suspects.},

@misc{Janssen2005,
abstract = {1. Introduction Agent-based modelling (ABM) is the computational study of social agents as evolving systems of autonomous interacting agents. ABM is a tool for the study of social systems from the complex adaptive system perspective. From this perspective, the researcher is interested in how macro phenomena are emerging from micro level behaviour among a heterogeneous set of interacting agents (Holland, 1992). By using ABM as computational laboratories, one may test in a systematic way different hypotheses related to attributes of the agents, their behavioural rules, and the types of interactions, and their effect on macro level stylized facts of the system. Since the early 1990s ABM has increasingly been used in most of the social sciences. I shall focus on the applications of ABM related to ecological economics (Janssen, 2002, 2005; Janssen and Ostrom, 2005). ABM of ecological economic systems can be defined as systems that are populated with heterogeneous population of agents, who determine their interactions with other agents and with their environment, on the basis of internalized social norms and mental models, internal behavioural rules and cognitive abilities, formal and informal institutional rules that affect how agents interact, individual and social learning, etc.},

abstract = {Can government policies that increase the monopoly power of firms and the militancy of unions increase output?? This paper shows that the answer is yes under certain 'emergency' conditions. These emergency conditions-zero interest rates and deflation-were satisfied during the Great Depression in the United States. The New Deal, which facilitated monopolies and union militancy, was therefore expansionary in the model presented. This conclusion is contrary to a large previous literature. The main reason for this divergence is that this paper incorporates rigid prices and the zero bound on the short-term interest rate. JEL: E23, E32, E52, E62, J51, N12, N42 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Bekiros2015,
abstract = {Until recently economists focused on structural models that were constrained by a lack of high-frequency data and theoretical deficiencies. Little academic research has been invested in actually trying to build successful real-time trading models for the high-frequency foreign exchange market, which is characterized by inherent complexity and heterogeneity. The present work opens new directions for inference on market efficiency in an attempt to account for the use of technical analysis by practitioners over many years now. This paper presents a heuristic model that efficiently emulates the dynamic learning of intraday traders. The proposed setup incorporates agent beliefs, preferences and expectations while it integrates the calibration of technical rules by means of adaptive training. The study focuses on EUR/USD which is the most liquid and widely traded currency pair. The data consist of a very large tick-by-tick sample of bid and ask prices covering many trading periods to enhance robustness in the results. The efficiency of a technical trading strategy based on the proposed model is investigated in terms of directional predictability. The heuristic learning system is compared against many non-linear models, a random walk and a buy {\&} hold strategy. Based on statistical testing it is shown that, with the inclusion of transaction costs, the profitability of the new model is consistently superior. These findings provide evidence of technical predictability under incomplete information and can be justified by invoking the existence of heterogeneity caused by many factors affecting market microstructure. Overall, the results suggest that the proposed model can be used to improve upon traditional technical analysis approaches.},

It is argued that capital-based regulation and the Basel-style capital regulation cannot deal with financial crises and that attention should be paid to liquidity and leverage. The Accord is criticised, in view of what happened during the crisis, for allowing the use of bank internal models to determine capital charges, for boosting procyclicality of the banking industry, for reliance on rating agencies and for being an exclusionary, discriminatory and a one-size-fits-all approach. It may not be possible to salvage Basel II, and the way forward is perhaps to abandon the idea of unified international financial regulation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Since the demand created by subprime lending feeds back onto house prices, such lending also helps to fuel an emerging housing bubble. These ideas are illustrated in a theoretical model, and tentative support is found in empirical work exploring the connection between price expectations and the extent of subprime lending. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The effect of these risks on property prices is negative and significant. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify these impacts in the Hedonic pricing literature applied to real estate. Size, the number of parking spaces, the age of the property, the incidence of crime, and the average income in the neighborhood are significant determinants of prices. Finally, this paper analyzes the microeconomic determinants of housing prices at the municipal level.},

The most vivid examples are the 2008 failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Dealer banks are often parts of large complex financial organizations whose failures can damage the economy significantly. As a result, they are sometimes considered “too big to fail.” The mechanics by which dealer banks can fail and the policies available to treat the systemic risk of their failures differ markedly from the case of conventional commercial bank runs. These failure mechanics are the focus of this article. This is not a review of the financial crisis of 2007–2009. Systemic risk is considered only in passing.

Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science-all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street. Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts-or the way his work has been used to cast doubt-on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift. Even Weinberg has said that "Structure has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science."

Drawing from recent advances in exchange rate regime classifications, this paper begins to fill this gap by investigating the impact of exchange rate regimes on international tourism flows. The study employs a system generalized methods of moments (SYS-GMM) estimation for tourist arrivals on a panel of 27 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non OECD countries for the period 1980-2011. The results identify multiple exchange rate regime effects and support the importance of maintaining a relatively stable exchange rate to attract international tourist arrivals. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

While the theory contains many remarkable insights, economists have found it challenging to apply these insights, and it is only recently that there has been real progress in doing so. In this paper, after first reviewing prospect theory and the difficulties inherent in applying it, I discuss some of this recent work. While it is too early to declare this research effort an unqualified success, the rapid progress of the last decade makes me optimistic that at least some of the insights of prospect theory will eventually find a permanent and significant place in mainstream economic analysis.},

ABM allows the disaggregation of systems into individual components that can potentially have their own characteristics and rule sets. This is a powerful paradigm that can be exploited through simulation to further our knowledge of the workings of geographical systems. We present in this chapter an overview of ABM; the main features of an agent-based model are given, along with a discussion of what constitutes an agent-based model. The distinction between cellular automata (CA), microsimulation (MSM) and agent-based models are discussed along with the advantages and limitations of ABM for modelling geographical systems. We conclude with a brief discussion of important areas for further research.},

abstract = {This paper structurally interprets empirical results obtained from Blanchard and Quah (1989) decompositions of output into permanent and transitory shocks. This is done based on assumptions about the qualitative responses of variables to structural shocks that are consistent with many different economic theories. Impulse responses of output to a permanent shock typically behave in a particular way before World War I that is unusual compared to post-World War II responses. Also, permanent shocks typically explain a larger share of output variance in that earlier period. We show these two empirical results support the hypothesis that a positive (negative) aggregate demand shock had a permanent positive (negative) effect on output in the pre-World War I period. Thus further support is obtained for that hypothesis based on more robust empirical findings and less restrictive structural assumptions. Another empirical result is that impulse responses from the data for post-World War II developed economies are typically qualitatively consistent with the effects of structural shocks from a standard textbook macro model. We show that Blanchard and Quah's statistical model will obtain impulse responses that appear consistent with simple textbook theories as the parameter measuring aggregate demand's long-run output effect is varied over a specific range. This analysis provides a range of non-neutralities for which results from Blanchard and Quah decompositions of output could be mistaken as structural. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The interwar period was marked by the end of the classical gold standard regime and new levels of macroeconomic disorder in the world economy. The interwar disorder often is linked to policies inconsistent with the constraint of the open-economy trilemma—the inability of policymakers simultaneously to pursue a fixed exchange rate, open capital markets, and autonomous monetary policy. The first two objectives were linchpins of the pre-1914 order As increasingly democratic polities faced pressures to engage in domestic macroeconomic management, however, either currency pegs or freedom of capital movements had to yield. This historical analytic narrative is compelling—with significant ramifications for today's world, if true—but empirically controversial. We apply theory and empirics to the interwar data and find strong support for the logic of the trilemma. Thus, an inability to pursue consistent policies in a rapidly changing political and economic environment appears central to an understanding of the interwar crises, and the same constraints still apply today.

We identify the stylized facts and main drivers of this development. The retrenchment in international capital flows is a highly heterogeneous phenomenon: first across time, being especially dramatic in the wake of the Lehman Brothers' failure, second across types of flows, with banking flows being the hardest hit due to their sensitivity of risk perception, and third across regions, with emerging economies experiencing a shorter-lived retrenchment than developed economies. Our econometric analysis shows that the magnitude of the retrenchment in capital flows across countries is linked to the extent of international financial integration, its specific nature—with countries relying on bank flows being the hardest hit—as well as domestic macroeconomic conditions and their connection to world trade flows.},

abstract = {Capital requirements are the cornerstone of modern bank regulation, yet little is known about their welfare cost. This paper measures this cost and finds that it is surprisingly large. I present a simple framework which embeds the role of liquidity creating banks in an otherwise standard general equilibrium growth model. A capital requirement limits the moral hazard on the part of banks that arises due to deposit insurance. However, this capital requirement is also costly because it reduces the ability of banks to create liquidity. The key insight is that equilibrium asset returns reveal the strength of households' preferences for liquidity and this allows for the derivation of a simple formula for the welfare cost of capital requirements that is a function of observable variables only. Using U.S. data, the welfare cost of current capital adequacy regulation is found to be equivalent to a permanent loss in consumption of between 0.1 and 1 percent.},

@article{prospect,
abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low prob- abilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

abstract = {We examine the impact of “substantially heightened” capital requirements on large financial institutions, and on their customers. Our analysis yields three main conclusions. First, the frictions associated with raising new external equity finance are likely to be greater than the ongoing costs of holding equity on the balance sheet, implying that the new requirements should be phased in gradually. Second, the long-run steady-state impact on loan rates is likely to be modest, in the range of 25 to 45 basis points for a ten percentage-point increase in the capital requirement. Third, due to the unique nature of competition in financial services, even these modest effects raise significant concerns about migration of credit-creation activity to the shadow-banking sector, and the potential for increased fragility of the overall financial system that this might bring. Thus to avoid tilting the playing field in such a way as to generate a variety of damaging unintended consequences, increased regulation of the shadowbanking sector should be seen as an important complement to the reforms that are contemplated for banks and other large financial institutions.},

Even though a large number of texts in Wikipedia cite external sources according to the intentions of the verifiability policy, many articles lack references and in many others the references have been added afterwards. Method. This article reports the results of a Web survey of information source use patterns, answered by 108 Wikipedia contributors in spring 2008. Analysis. The qualitative questions were analysed using a close reading and grounded theory approach. The multiple-choice questions were analysed using descriptive statistics and bi-variate correlation analysis. Results. The results indicate that there are several distinct groups of contributors using different information sources. The results also indicate a preference for sources available online. However, in spite of the popularity of online material a significant proportion of the original information is based on printed literature, personal expertise and other non-digital sources of information. The information source use of Wikipedia contributors is also illustrative of the complexity and life-world scope of human information behaviour. Conclusions. Understanding the information source use of contributors helps us to understand how new Wikipedia articles emerge, how edits are motivated, where the information actually comes from and more generally, what kind of information may be expected to be found in Wikipedia.},

The opening chapter puts the interwar years in the long-term quantitative perspective of economic development over the whole of the 20th century while the final chapter highlights the long-run impact of the interwar years on the growth and policy features of the prosperous decades that followed the end of the Second World War.},

Following the onset of the subprime crisis in July 2007, spreads rose but mainly on account of common global factors. The rescue of Bear Stearns in March 2008 marked a turning point. Countries thereafter were increasingly differentiated. Sovereign spreads of a eurozone country tended to rise when the prospects of its domestic financial sector worsened. It appears, therefore, that the rescue of Bear Stearns created a link between financial sector vulnerabilities and a larger contingent liability on public finances. Following the failure of Lehman Brothers, spreads also rose faster for countries with higher ratios of public debt-to-GDP. These transitional dynamics appear to have concluded with the nationalization of Anglo Irish: sovereign spreads throughout the eurozone jumped, with the jump emphasizing the differentiation by financial sector vulnerability and public debt levels. The results imply that, to varying degrees, countries may have moved to a new regime of weak economic outlook, financial sector fragilities, and strains on public finances.},

abstract = {Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach to modelling systems composed of autonomous, interacting agents. Agent-based modelling is a way to model the dynamics of complex systems and complex adaptive systems. Such systems often self-organize themselves and create emergent order. Agent-based models also include models of behaviour (human or otherwise) and are used to observe the collective effects of agent behaviours and interactions. The development of agent modelling tools, the availability of micro-data, and advances in computation have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications across a variety of domains and disciplines. This article provides a brief introduction to ABMS, illustrates the main concepts and foundations, discusses some recent applications across a variety of disciplines, and identifies methods and toolkits for developing agent models.},

We find that stocks held by these Lehman-connected funds experienced greater declines in market liquidity following the bankruptcy than other stocks; the effect was larger for ex ante illiquid stocks and persisted into the beginning of 2009. We find no similar effects surrounding the Bear Stearns failure, suggesting that disruptions surrounding bankruptcy explain the liquidity effects. We conclude that shocks to traders' funding liquidity reduce the market liquidity of the assets that they trade. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The paper presents an empirical analysis of the alleged transformation of the financial systems in the three major European economies, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Based on a unified data set developed on the basis of national accounts statistics, and employing a new and consistent method of measurement, the following question is addressed: Is there a general trend toward disintermediation, with banks losing importance to the markets, that is causing these three financial systems to converge? We find that there is neither a general trend toward disintermediation, nor toward a transformation from bank-based to capital market-based financial systems, nor toward a loss of importance of banks. Only in the case of France could strong signs of transformation as well as signs of a general decline in the role of banks be found. Thus the three financial systems also do not seem to be converging. However, there is also a common pattern of change: the intermediation chains are lengthening in all three countries. Nonbank financial intermediaries are taking over a more important role as mobilizers of capital from the nonfinancial sectors. In combination with the trend toward securitization of bank liabilities, this change increases the funding costs of banks and may put banks under pressure. In the case of France, this change is so pronounced that it might even threaten the stability of the financial system. Journal of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: G21 and G23.},

This paper provides a quantitative view and estimates the long-run costs and benefits of substantially higher capital requirements using empirical evidence on Swiss banks to assess both benefits and costs. The analysis yields two main conclusions. The long-run economic benefits of higher capital requirements are substantial for the Swiss economy leading to a significantly lower probability of banking crises and associated expected losses. In contrast the costs of higher capital requirements as reflected in increased lending spreads and potential output reductions are literally non-existent.},

We parameterized the trading rule by generating 96 different configurations and reported the results of the whole sample over 3 subperiods. In order to widen its validity we also replicated the analysis on two leading European indexes: the German DAX and the British FTSE. The returns provided by the proposed trading rule are higher for the European than for the US index, which highlights the greater inefficiency of the European markets.},

abstract = {The paper analyses the causes of the current crisis of the global financial system, with particular emphasis on the systemic elements that turned the crisis of subprime mortgage-backed securities in the United States, a small part of the overall system, into a worldwide crisis. The first half of the paper explains the role of mortgage securitization as a mechanism for allocating risks from real estate investments and discusses what has gone wrong and why in the implementation of this mechanism in the United States. The second half of the paper discusses the incidence of systemic risk in the crisis. Two elements of systemic risk are identified. First, there was excessive matu- rity transformation through conduits and structured-investment vehicles (SIVs); when this broke down in August 2007, the overhang of asset-backed securities that had been held by these vehicles put significant additional downward pressure on securities prices. Second, as the financial sys- tem adjusted to the recognition of delinquencies and defaults in US mortgages and to the break- down of maturity transformation of conduits and SIVs, the interplay of market malfunctioning or even breakdown, fair value accounting and the insufficiency of equity capital at financial insti- tutions, and, finally, systemic effects of prudential regulation created a detrimental downward spi- ral in the overall financial system. The paper argues that these developments have not only been caused by identifiably faulty decisions, but also by flaws in financial system architecture. In think- ing about regulatory reform, one must therefore go beyond considerations of individual incentives and supervision and pay attention to issues of systemic interdependence and transparency},

The recent turmoil in financial markets, however, has raised questions about whether fair value accounting is exacerbating the problems. In this paper, we review the history and practice of fair value accounting, and summarize the literature on the channels through which it can adversely affect the real economy. We propose a new model to study the interaction of accounting rules with regulatory capital requirements, and show that even when market prices always reflect fundamental values, the interaction of fair value accounting rules and a simple capital requirement can create inefficiencies that are absent when capital is measured by adjusted book value. These distortions can be avoided, however, by redefining capital requirements to be procyclical rather than by abandoning fair value accounting and the other benefits that it provides. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Relative to historical cost accounting, MTM could induce banks to retain excessive exposure to the risk of the loans they originated, damage price discovery in the loan market, and reduce banks' ex-ante incentive to originate good loans. These results imply an economy with an inefficient risk distribution and a lower overall loan quality, two important factors that have contributed to the current financial crisis.},

The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of circumstances, of which one must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form, but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge, which all the separate individuals possess. The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate "given" resources, if given is taken to mean given to a single mind, which deliberately solves the problem set by these data. It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any member of society, for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know. Or, to put it briefly, it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality. In this article, the author deals with the problem of a rational economic organization. In ordinary language the word "planning" is described as the complex of interrelated decisions about the allocation of our available resources. Various ways, in which the knowledge, on which people base their plans is communicated to them is the crucial problem for any theory explaining the economic process.},

abstract = {The causes of the 2008 collapse and subsequent surge in global capital flows remain an open and highly controversial issue. Employing a factor model coupled with a dataset of high-frequency portfolio capital flows to 50 economies, the paper finds that common shocks – key crisis events as well as changes to global liquidity and risk – have exerted a large effect on capital flows both in the crisis and in the recovery. However, these effects have been highly heterogeneous across countries, with a large part of this heterogeneity being explained by differences in the quality of domestic institutions, country risk and the strength of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. Comparing and quantifying these effects shows that common factors (“push” factors) were overall the main drivers of capital flows during the crisis, while country-specific determinants (“pull” factors) have been dominant in accounting for the dynamics of global capital flows in 2009 and 2010, in particular for emerging markets},

The literature on technical analysis has established that simple technical trading rules on dollar exchange rates provided 15 years of positive, risk-adjusted returns during the 1970s and 80s before those returns were extinguished. More recently, more complex and less studied rules have produced more modest returns for a similar length of time. Conventional explanations that rely on risk adjustment and/or central bank intervention do not plausibly justify the observed excess returns from following simple technical trading rules. Psychological biases, however, could contribute to the profitability of these rules. We view the observed pattern of excess returns to technical trading rules as being consistent with an adaptive markets view of the world.},

abstract = {In a dynamic model of financial market trading multiple heterogeneously informed traders choose when to place orders. Better informed traders trade immediately, worse informed delay – even though they expect the market to move against them. This behavior generates intraday patterns with decreasing spreads, decreasing probability of informed trading (PIN), and increasing volume. We predict that policies that foster market entry improve the welfare of uninformed traders and lead to increased market participation by incumbent traders. Technological advances that lead to better signal processing also encourage market participation and increase volume but at the expense of uninformed traders' welfare.},

abstract = {Im September 2011 legte die Schweizerische Nationalbank (SNB) eine Kursuntergrenze des Euro gegen�ber dem Franken von 1,20 fest. Dieser Mindestkurs wurde im Januar 2015 �berraschend aufgehoben. Nach Ansicht von Peter Bernholz, Universit�t Basel, sind die Folgen der Freigabe zurzeit noch nicht abzusch�tzen. Ein l�ngeres Verbleiben des Wechselkurses in der N�he von einem Franken je Euro k�nnte dramatische Folgen f�r die reale Wirtschaft der Schweiz haben, so dass es sinnvoll sei, m�gliche Alternativen zur gegenw�rtigen Politik der SNB zu diskutieren. F�r Ernst Baltensperger, Universit�t Bern, war die Aufhebung des SNB-Mindestkurses richtig. Das internationale Umfeld habe sich seit Herbst 2011 markant ver�ndert. Trotz aller verbliebenen Risiken seien global gesehen wesentlich normalere Verh�ltnisse, in denen internationale Kapitalstr�me durch Ertragsdifferenzen und �konomisch nachvollziehbare Faktoren bestimmt werden, zur�ckgekehrt. �ber die vergangenen drei Jahre jedoch habe die Mindestkurspolitik der Schweizer Volkswirtschaft eine Anpassungsfrist von drei Jahren gew�hrt und zahlreichen Unternehmungen erlaubt, sich rechtzeitig auf neue Verh�ltnisse einzustellen. David Iselin, ETH Z�rich, sieht erste Anzeichen, dass wieder vermehrt Dollar nachgefragt werden. Doch weltweit gebe es auf dem W�hrungsmarkt wenige so attraktive W�hrungen wie den Franken. Mit der Aufgabe des Mindestkurses zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt spekuliere die SNB auf einen baldigen Attraktivit�tsverlust des Frankens. Wo der genau herkommen solle, sei aber vielen unklar. Oliver Landmann, Universit�t Freiburg, vermisst eine glaubw�rdige und transparente geldpolitische Strategie der SNB. Eine solche sei derzeit nicht erkennbar. Hier bestehe eine Bringschuld, um deren Einl�sung die SNB nicht herumkommen werde. Nach Meinung von Rudolf Minsch, economiesuisse, ist die Frankenaufwertung kurzfristig schlecht, aber langfristig gut. Die Aufwertung stelle die Schweizer Unternehmen vor riesige Her},

abstract = {Praise for Handbook of Exchange Rates. "This book is remarkable. I expect it to become the anchor reference for people working in the foreign exchange field." -Richard K. Lyons, Dean and Professor of Finance,Haas School of Business, University of California Berkeley. "It is quite easily the most wide ranging treaty of expertise on the forex market I have ever come across. I will be keeping a copy close to my fingertips." -Jim O'Neill, Chairman, Goldman Sachs Asset Management. How should we evaluate the forecasting power of models? What are appropriate loss functions for major market participants? Is the exchange rate the only means of adjustment? Handbook of Exchange Rates answers these questions and many more, equipping readers with the relevant concepts and policies for working in today's international economic climate. Featuring contributions written by leading specialists from the global financial arena, this handbook provides a collection of original ideas on foreign exchange (FX) rates in four succinct sections: Overview introduces the history of the FX market and exchange rate regimes, discussing key instruments in the trading environment as well as macro and micro approaches to FX determination. Exchange Rate Models and Methods focuses on forecasting exchange rates, featuring methodological contributions on the statistical methods for evaluating forecast performance, parity relationships, fair value models, and flow-based models. FX Markets and Products outlines active currency management, currency hedging, hedge accounting; high frequency and algorithmic trading in FX; and FX strategy-based products. FX Markets and Policy explores the current policies in place in global markets and presents a framework for analyzing financial crises. Throughout the book, topics are explored in-depth alongside their founding principles. Each chapter uses real-world examples from the financial industry and concludes with a summary that outlines key points and concepts. Handbook of Exchange Rates is an essential reference for fund managers and investors as well as practitioners and researchers working in finance, banking, business, and econometrics. The book also serves as a valuable supplement for courses on economics, business, and international finance at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

They find several results: (i) before the crisis, differences in capital did not affect subsequent stock returns; (ii) during the crisis, higher capital resulted in better stock performance, most markedly for larger banks and less well-capitalized banks; (iii) the relationship between stock returns and capital is stronger when capital is measured by the leverage ratio rather than the risk-adjusted capital ratio; (iv) there is evidence that higher quality forms of capital, such as Tier 1 capital, were more relevant.

According to the author, he completely agrees with the important point critics of his article make that the increased demand for money resulting from an increase in activity has a backwash, which tends to raise the rate of interest. According to the author, it is a significant element in his theory of why booms carry within them the seeds of their own destruction. The author believes that money serves two principal purposes. By acting as a money of account it facilitates exchanges without its being necessary that it should ever itself come into the picture as a substantive object. Moreover, it is a store of wealth. The author claims that the difference from the traditional theory concerns its apparent conviction that there is no necessity to work out a theory of the demand and supply of output as a whole. According to the author, the rate of interest measures the premium, which has to be offered to induce people to hold their wealth in some form other than hoarded money.},

abstract = {In a roundtable discussion, a panel of financial reporting experts discuss the role of accounting in the market turmoil that began in August with the collapse of two Bear Stearns funds. Robert Herz, FASB chairman thinks that what they have learned in the last three to five years is in residential mortgages that these assets are not passive in nature. What Michael Hall, partner, KPMG LLP, has seen over the years has been each time there's a market event, it's usually a call for a change in the accounting. Gordon Goodman, trading control officer, Occidental Petroleum Corp, said when you look at the question of the difference in the quality of earnings, there's a significant difference between the things that have happened that are realized and are fixed and the things that have not yet happened that are unrealized and that are floating.},

abstract = {This chapter describes the process of characterisation and parameterisation of computer agents in the case of decision making of profit-driven companies in a competitive electricity market. It focuses on adaptive behaviour of generation and investment companies in Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) as modelled by Genersys. Through initiatives such as formal focus group meetings, gathering observations of industry experts, analysing market data and a selective approach in representing real systems, modellers can improve the design and potential future use of their simulation systems.},
